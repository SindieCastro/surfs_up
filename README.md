### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to capture the weather trends for June and December in Oahu.

### Results

These are the results for the June and December temperatures (See Table One): 

- The average June temperature was 74.94 degrees Fahrenheit while the average for December was a degrees lower at 71.04.
- The minimum June temperature was 64 degrees Fahrenheit while the December minimum temperate was much lower at 56.
- The maximum June temperature was 85 degrees Fahrenheit while the December maximum temperature was very close at 83.

Table One: June and December Temperatures
Month | Average Temperature | Minimum Temperature | Maximum Temperature 
------------ | -------------| -------------|------------ 
June  |  74.94  |64.00 | 85 
December | 71.04 |56.00	| 83.00 

### Summary
